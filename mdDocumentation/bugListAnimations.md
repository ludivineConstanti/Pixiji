# Bug List GSAP ðŸ˜µ

## The animation on hover, made with GSAP, blocked when the mouse entered the div slightly (when the enter and exit event of the mouse were not clear)
=> Fixed by using a timeline for the animation

## Passing a ref to a component not working

=> I tried to make a custom element "MainSquare" for the illustrations, but passing a ref as a prop does not work in React, after reading the React doc, I found out that it does work if we use "React.forwardRef" to create the component, instead of making a simple function

## Using redux with "React.forwardRef" not working

=> Using redux modified the react component and converted it back to a function, which made using "React.forwardRef" pointless,it now works by adding extra arguments
``` Javascript
export default connect(mapStateToProps, {}, null, { forwardRef: true })(Component);
```

### Width of the button component was not big enough after the GSAP animation

=> the width was using vw, every time GSAP performs a "to" animation in reverse, it just takes the previous value in px, therefore it doesn't work well with it
=> removed the width prop at the end of the animation

### Width of the menu button not being the right dimensions after the GSAP animation

=> same problem, the value is put back in px.  
=> I tried using a fromTo animation so that it goes back to a value with vw instead of just px, but the animation didn't transition smoothly (it looked like it was first changing the position of the button menu and then scaling it, instead of doing both at the same time smoothly).  
=> I used scale instead.  
=> I feel like every time I use width and height for animations, instead of scale, GSAP is trying to tell me that I shouldn't do it.  
=> I read some comments on the internet about it, it seems scale does generally produce smoother results because of "subpixel rendering". It is generally recommended to use CSS transforms and opacity properties (x, y rotation, rotation, rotationX, rotationY, scaleX, scaleY or just scale, skewX and skewY) for animation. "Changing values that are not CSS Transforms or opacity can cause the browser to re-do its layout of the page which in extreme situations can hinder performance." (src: course from creative coding club).

## Hue changing on hover even though it was not animated

=> The animation that I use to make the squares darker on hover (so that the kanjis and their translation are more readable) should only animate the saturation and lightness of those square, but it changed from purple to green to red very fast for one of them (which was originally red).
=> I tested with an over hue as a starting color (the one I used originally was 360), it worked by replacing 360 by 359, apparently GSAP has some trouble with some values (this one being the maximum hue we can put, it could be the reason?).

## Quiz Illustration not behaving properly

=> The quiz Illustration was not shrinking at the beggining of a quiz
=> turns out I forgot the if statement that blocks the animation from starting if the array of quiz answers is not empty (and at the moment, I do not suppress the answers, even if you leave the quiz) 
=> I put an other condition to see if you're just starting the quiz or not (might have to change it later depending on what I decide UX wise)

## Menu icon not updating to the proper color

=> I had a lot of problems with the color of the icon animation, first with GSAP, where it worked fine on the first page, but the colors value didn't update for the others, and then it kept a history of the colors, so it cycled through all of them...
=> Most of the problems were solved when I started to use framer-motion, which is better integrated (to my knowledge) with react's lifecycle, but it still didn't want to update the colors properly.
=> I still don't know why it didn't work, but I found an alternative way of toggling the color when it changes from the menu icon state, to the cross state, just by giving it as color prop to styled component (white if the menu is open and the current color if it's closed), and this one updates the colors correctly. Otherwise  just update the animate animation with a hook.

## GSAP reverse animation not working

The GSAP animations were working fine while using .to, but nothing happened while using reverse. After research, I found out that the hooks and lifecycle of React components can mix up badly with GSAP's timeline. However, by using hooks to create and modify the timeline, both work fine together.

## Having the divs scaling from the center on hover

=> modifying the height and width property scales from the top right, to scale from the center, I can either use x any to put it back in place or use scale.

``` JavaScript
// converts the size of the div we get in pixels to vw
const componentWidth = componentRef.current.clientWidth / document.documentElement.clientWidth * 100;
// 8.8 => scale we want in vw
const componentScale = 8.8 / componentWidth;
tl.to(componentRef.current, 0.35, {
    // scaling messes up all the sizes so need to divide them per the component scale (typo size..)
ease: 'power1.inOut', zIndex: 10, scale: componentScale, fontSize: `${2 / componentScale}vw`,
}).play();
```

``` JavaScript
// converts the size of the div we get in pixels to vw
const componentWidth = componentRef.current.clientWidth / document.documentElement.clientWidth * 100;
// 8.8 => scale we want in vw
const componentNewSize = 8.8;
const componentOffset = (componentWidth - componentNewSize) / 2;
tl.to(componentRef.current, 0.35, {
ease: 'power1.inOut', zIndex: 10, y: `${componentOffset}vw`, x: `${componentOffset}vw`, height: `${componentNewSize}vw`, width: `${componentNewSize}vw`, fontSize: '2vw',
}).play();
```

Somehow, causes the typo in the center to jump a bit sometimes, so I'll go with changing width and height.

## Update nÂ°1 having the divs scaling from the center on hover

Changing the height and width of the div and changing it's position by using x and y works properly 95% of the time... but sometimes it has a side effect, which consist in animating the div continuously in seemingly random directions on hover. It took me a while to find out why. It seems to work better if I round down the value of translation (before I had something like y: 2.7523124326vw which is calculated automatically based on the screen size and the div's width). The down side is that the squares can not be aligned with the others on the grid if I make the value less precise.

I started testing with using percentage instead of vw, but I have different div width, which means I would need to calculate based on each individually, and somehow, the animation doesn't seem to start from the center (which works fine with the vw), it looks like it's making a diagonal translation, even when it should stay centered.

## Update nÂ°2 having the divs scaling from the center on hover

After transitioning to framer-motion, I updated the scale instead of the width and the height, and it worked just fine. I had to animate the typo too, so that it's not influenced by the scale (I wanted to scale the parent div instead, but then it influences the total width that the text can take).

## Animating typo in GSAP

I tried animating the typo size from 0 to something in GSAP (just for one part of the text, the text at the center of the div stays visible). It gave a slight staggering effect. I decided to simply remove this animation, (since I already have fade in and fade out on the text anyway, and I still need to figure out how to organise GSAP and SASS so that they work together, having different style in both is a bit messy).

=> I thought GSAP would solve all problems linked to layout moving, turns out it doesn't do it 100%, which means I shoudl spend more time on learning what modifies the layout and what doesn't.

## Clear GSAP inline styling

I tried clearing the inline style that I added with gsap, at the end of the reversed animation (so when I don't need them anymore), since it caused bugs in an other of my animation, so I thought removing them for all might be a good practice... after trying it out it seems to add more bugs... so I won't remove the online styling anymore (unless when needed).

## Update nÂ°1 clear GSAP inline styling

I realised removing inline styling was actually necessary because modifying the position of the elements by inline styling make them not resize properly (which doesn't matter when we are doing the hover effect, because hovering over the div and resizing the browser's window at the same time should be difficult). After a bit of testing with removing the properties and, causing more bugs doing so (div glitching...), I found out that removing the properties should not be done on the GSAP timeline directly but with TweenLite. I did so with an event callback function and now it seems to be much better.

## Update nÂ°2 clear GSAP inline styling

After reading the doc to understand what is TweenLite and why it's working better, I learned that it's actually deprecated (as is TweenMax, TimelineMax and TimelineLite) and has been replaced by gsap that covers all their fonctionnalities. But clearing props still works better with a callback function, instead of adding it directly to the timeline.

## Update nÂ°3 clear GSAP inline styling

After transitioning to Framer motion, I expected to have the same bug, but it worked fine without me needing to change anything. I guess the way they handle things internally is different even though they both use JavaScript.

## Blurry text

Sometimes, the text appears blurry, I read in a GSAP forum that it can happen when you apply transformations for your element, since GSAP uses 3D transform to save on performance. It can be changed with gsap.config(force3D: false), but then performance drops, so will have to test it if I see too much blurry text (or just have to avoid using scale, which would be a shame since animations of type transform are more performant).

## The as prop of styled component doesn't work with animate of framer motion

To my knowledge, there's no solution to this, so I just stopped using as (I didn't find a solution on the forums, but might be that they fixed it or are planning to...).

## The colors don't properly update

I have one mainColor that I stock in my state, which worked fine when the site is loaded but didn't always update afterward. This problem was fixed when I started using animate presence in the app component, which also fixes the problem I had with intro animations not always triggering when (except when you reloaded the page).

I had a lot of similar problems with animating the colors, but I either removed the animation (and then it gets the color automatically updated from styled-component) or I update the animate animation (from framer-motion) when the color changes, and then it fixes it.
