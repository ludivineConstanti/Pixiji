# Bug List ðŸ˜µ

#### The square (child of the div in grid displayed) takes the entire width instead of taking the dimensions the CSS ask it to
=> I put the parent class name on the child as well, which made it have the grid settings as well  
=> Fixed by changing class

## The same dispatched action was executed multiple times (between 2 and 8)
=> Apparently, react components rendering multiple times is a common issue, which was, I believe, the origin of the problem, I read [an article](https://mariosfakiolas.com/blog/my-react-components-render-twice-and-drive-me-crazy/) that said that strict mode makes every component render twice in dev mode (but I am currently not using strict mode), [an other one](https://medium.com/unsplash/react-redux-performance-considerations-when-dispatching-multiple-actions-5162047bf8a6) that said that React component re-render every time a new action is dispatched  
=> I originally created a value in my React component, then dispatched the value, and then reused the values that I just updated, from the props (I thought always using the values from the store might be more consistent, having only one source for all informations). I then tried using the value directly instead of recuperating it from the store and it solved the rerender issue.

#### Disabling the button element not working properly 
=> I used a state directly in the button element and set it to disabled when the user clicked on it, logically it only updated this one button
=> I used the parent element instead to decide if the elements are disabled or not, every time the element is rerendered (which happens when I click on one button, since I modify the state)

## Removing kanjis from the kanjis array, the illustration used for deco also remove it from the quiz

I thought the data array from the kanjis was not going to be affected if I remove some characters from it, in another file, but I was wrong. I then tried again with making a local copy of it, but it didn't work (since it was a dynamic one). After another try, using the spread opearator, in an array, to make a copy, it worked.

## Modifying the 1st element of an array in redux

=> I was not able to access the first element of the array I wanted to modify (tried accessing it by writing state.array[0], for some reasons it didn't work), I therefore decided to read the redux official documentation, to understand better how it work (so far I only used it based on the knowledge I got from the bootcamp I did) and I discovered redux toolkit which reduced the code by a lot, and is (in my opinion) easier to use. I then decided to use it and now the code works.
