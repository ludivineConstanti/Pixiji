## Modifying the 1st element of an array in redux

=> I was not able to access the first element of the array I wanted to modify (tried accessing it by writing state.array[0], for some reasons it didn't work), I therefore decided to read the redux official documentation, to understand better how it work (so far I only used it based on the knowledge I got from the bootcamp I did) and I discovered redux toolkit which reduced the code by a lot, and is (in my opinion) easier to use. I then decided to use it and now the code works.
